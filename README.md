A coding assignment as part of a job application.


##iMDVy
Using React, Node, Gulp, Browserify to show to relationships between lists of Actors, Directors, and Movies. For right now, it's a very MVP version of what I want to accomplish, but then again I have big eyes!

To Get Started:
```
npm install
```
```
run Gulp production
```
```
run Gulp
```

run on localhost:3000 (either nodemon or node app.js, or any other witchcraft you prefer)



###TODO: things I dream about at night and will finish with later :)
- implement caching, instead of making multiple GET requests
- deployed with postgreSQL db
- more exported helper functions: ajax calls
- Promisify the nested ajax calls
- more gulp tasks, ie. use gulp-notify to notify of the jsx errors
- use either display:inline vs hidden for toggling related details
- use iMDB (or similar) API for photos of the actors, directors, and movies
- tests: jest, mocha, jasmine
